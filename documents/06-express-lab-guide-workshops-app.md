# Building the Workshops App API Server using Express JS
We build the API server for the Workshops App (serves only data, and not HTML views).

- __Documentation__:
    - https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/
    - https://expressjs.com/
- __Production database__: `mongodb+srv://admin:<db_password>@cluster0.9d7mmqx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
    - Check with the instructor for `db_password`
- Completed frontend app can be run from the `demos/01-angular/workshops-app` folder

## Before getting started
You will need Node `^18.0.0` in order to install Express 5. Install a compatible version of Node if you don't have one.
```
node --version
node -v
```
- __Reference__: https://nodejs.org/en
- You also need Postman to make HTTP requests. Download it from https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## Step 1: Create the Express app and run it
- Create a project folder and a `package.json` within it
```bash
mkdir workshops-app
cd workshops-app
npm init -y
```
- Install Express and nodemon
```bash
npm i express
npm i --save-dev nodemon
```

## Step 2: Set up environment variables
- You may set up an environment variable for `PORT`. Check how to create one in your shell (Windows CMD, Powershell, Linux / Mac OSX - bash, zsh etc.). Set it to something like `3000`.
- Alternatively, you can install dotenv package and store key-value pairs we shall be read into `process.env` object of Node JS. First install `dotenv` package that helps loads different environment variables for different environments (`production`, `development` etc.)
```bash
npm i dotenv
```
- Create a `.env` file for development use. Add the `PORT` variable in it.
```
PORT=3000
```

## Step 3: Create a basic Express server and start it
- Create an src folder
```bash
mkdir src
```

- In `src/app.js` load the variables in `.env` into `process.env` object of Node JS. Create a basic Express `Application` object and start the server associated with it on the specified port.
```js
require( 'dotenv' ).config(); // this is how we read and load the variables from the .env file
const express = require( 'express' );

const app = express();

app.get('/', ( req, res ) => {
    res.write( 'This is the workshops app. It serves details of workshops happening nearby.' );
    res.end();
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen( PORT );
```
- Add a start script in `package.json`. Set `src/app.js` as the main script.
```json
{
    "main": "src/app.js",
    "scripts": "nodemon"
}
```
- Start the app. Note that it restarts automatically if you make any changes in the application (change something in `app.js`). If you make changes to `.env` file though, you need to restart the ap manually (Ctrl+C to stop, then start it like so).
```bash
npm start
```

## Step 4: Modularizing routing using Router
- An app would have routes for various resources (`workshops`, `sessions`, `users` etc.). It is better to use the alternative way of setting up routes for every resource in a separate file. The `Router` object of Express helps do exactly this. We use one for every resource instead of setting up all routes on the `Application` object.
- First in `src/routes/index.route.js`, add the router with the index route (home route) set up. Note the difference between `res.end()` and `res.send()`. Redirection mechanism is also shown.
```js
const express = require( 'express' );

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', ( req, res ) => {
    // res.send() is an Express method built on top of Node JS ServerResponse object's res.end(). It automatically sets the appropriate Content-Type header based on the data.
    res.send( 'This is the workshops app. It serves details of workshops happening nearby.' );
});

router.get( '/home', ( req, res ) => {
    // tell the browser to make request to / instead. On receiving this response, the browser makes a new request to /
    res.redirect( '/' );
});

module.exports = router;
```
- Integrate the routing into the application by set the router as a __middleware__. We will see what a middleware is in more detail later. In `src/app.js`
```js
require( 'dotenv' ).config();
const express = require( 'express' );
const indexRouter = require( './routes/index.route' );

const app = express();

app.use( indexRouter );

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen( PORT );
```

## Step 5: Adding a workshops router
- Add a `src/data` folder. In `src/data/workshops.json` add workshops data.

    }
]
```
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`. We can read JSON files in Node by simply `require`ing them like JavaScript files. The JSON is read and parsed into an object of an appropriate JavaScript type and returned. Also note the use of `res.json()` to send data in JSON format (`Content-Type` header in response is set to `application/json`)
```js
const express = require( 'express' );
const workshops = require( '../data/workshops.json' );

const router = express.Router();

router.get( '/workshops', ( req, res ) => {
    res.json( workshops );
});

module.exports = router;
```
- Add the new Router in `src/app.js`
```js
const workshopsRouter = require( './routes/workshops.route' );
```
```js
app.use( indexRouter );
// add the new Routers to the application
app.use( workshopsRouter );
```
- Check `http://localhost:3000/workshops` in the browser - you should see the list of workshops being served.

## Step 6: Using Body parser middleware - Adding POST /workshops support that adds a new workshop
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`, add this
```js
router.post( '/workshops', ( req, res ) => {
    res.send( 'Hello Postman' );
});
```
- To test it out, open Postman app and make an HTTP POST request to http://localhost:3000/workshops
- Middleware is a function that is used for pre-processing requests (usually, before the request is handed over to the router), and post-processing responses (before they leave the app, i.e. sent to the network).
- Middleware can be added at the __application-level__, or __router-level__
  - __Application-level middleware__ can run on each incoming HTTP request - they are added using `app.use()` where `app` is the Application object. Common use-cases of application-level middleware are for serving static assets (HTML, CSS, JS files etc.), parsing request body, cookies on the incoming request, handling errors, that occur when processing requests, in a centralized fashion etc.
  - __Router-level middleware__ is set up on a router, and can run when a route matches the router's route. A common use-case of router-level middleware is to protect API endpoints that are available for authenticated / authorized users.
- Add HTTP request body parsing capability to the app using _body parser_ __midddleware__ configured for parsing JSON formatted data. In `src/app.js`. Note that the middleware functions execute one after the other in the order they are added when application starts up. __The body parser middleware MUST be added before the request reach the routers__. Else the request body will not be available to the router (in IncomingMessage `body` property i.e. in `req.body`)
```js
const app = express();

// configure application to read JSON data in incoming requests and set it up on req.body
app.use( express.json() );
```
- __NOTE__: In order to be able to read form data (i.e. with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), you will need to add this as well - `app.use( express.urlencoded() );`. We do not need to handle form submission as we are building an API server, and not accepting inputs through an HTML form submission from the browser.
- Modify the `POST /workshops` route handler to add the incoming workshop with a unique id. In `src/routes/workshops.route.js` make these changes - note the use of `res.status()` to set the status code - this is a method added by Express to the `ServerResponse` object of Node JS.
```js
let nextId = 13;
```
```js
router.post( '/workshops', ( req, res ) => {
    const newWorkshop = req.body;
    
    newWorkshop.id = nextId;
    ++nextId;
    workshops.push( newWorkshop );
    
    res.status( 201 ).send( newWorkshop );
});
```
- Make the POST request from Postman again. This time pass a new workshop data like so (choose __Body__ -> __Raw__ -> __JSON__).
```json
{
    "name": "jQuery",
    "category": "frontend",
    "description": "jQuery is a JavaScript library",
    "startDate": "2020-03-01T04:00:00.000Z",
    "endDate": "2020-03-03T08:00:00.000Z",
    "startTime": {
        "hours": 9,
        "minutes": 30
    },
    "endTime": {
        "hours": 13,
        "minutes": 30
    },
    "speakers": [
        "John Doe",
        "Jane Doe"
    ],
    "location": {
        "address": "Tata Elxsi, Prestige Shantiniketan",
        "city": "Bangalore",
        "state": "Karnataka"
    },
    "modes": {
        "inPerson": true,
        "online": false
    },
    "imageUrl": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/JQuery_logo.svg/524px-JQuery_logo.svg.png"
}
```
- You should see the new workshop details sent back - it will have the __"id"__ as well. Check `GET http://localhost:3000` as well - the list should have the new workshop.

## Step 7: Mounting the router on a different path - Refactoring routes
- We can pass a route as the first argument to `app.use()` - just the way we can for `router.*` methods. This is used to mount the router on the path - i.e. the router will be invoked only on path that match the router passed to `app.use()`. The path passed to the router is appended to this path, and the router middleware (function(s) passed to `router.*()`) are invoked only on the appended path.
- In `src/app.js`,
```js
app.use( indexRouter );
app.use( '/api/workshops', workshopsRouter );
```
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`,
```js
router.get( '/', ( req, res ) => {
    res.json( workshops );
});

router.post( '/', ( req, res ) => {
    const newWorkshop = req.body;

    newWorkshop.id = nextId;
    ++nextId;
    workshops.push( newWorkshop );

    res.status( 201 ).send( newWorkshop );
});
```
- In fact you can set up the routing using the common route '/' using `router.route()` as well
```js
router.route('/')
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.json(workshops);
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    const newWorkshop = req.body;

    newWorkshop.id = ++nextId;
    workshops.push(newWorkshop);

    res.status(201).json(newWorkshop);
  });
```
- Check that the GET and POST requests for workshops resource is now on `http://localhost:3000/api/workshops`

## Step 8: Validating using Joi, Adding an error response, and sending structured responses
- Let us first send responses in a more structured way. In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`
```js
router.route('/')
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.json({
      status: 'success',
      data: workshops
    });
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    const newWorkshop = req.body;

    newWorkshop.id = ++nextId;
    workshops.push(newWorkshop);

    res.status(201).json({
      status: 'success',
      data: newWorkshop
    });
  });
```
- Next, we validate the incoming workshop details in the POST request, and send appropriate error responses on errors. First install `joi`. Then add the following. Note that `abortEarly: false` makes Joi return all errors, not just the first. By default, Joi will perform type coercion — which means for eg. it converts numbers to strings when validating `Joi.string()` unless you explicitly tell it not to by setting `convert: false`.
```bash
npm i joi
```
- Now make the following changes
```js
const Joi = require('joi');
```
```js
// set up the Joi schema for validation
const timeSchema = Joi.object({
    hours: Joi.number().integer().min(0).max(23).required(),
    minutes: Joi.number().integer().min(0).max(59).required()
});

const workshopSchema = Joi.object({
    name: Joi.string().required(),
    category: Joi.string()
        .valid("frontend", "backend", "database", "devops", "language", "mobile")
        .required(),
    description: Joi.string().max(1024).required(),
    startDate: Joi.string().isoDate().required(),
    endDate: Joi.string().isoDate().required(),
    startTime: timeSchema.required(),
    endTime: timeSchema.required(),
    speakers: Joi.array().items(Joi.string()).min(1).required(),
    location: Joi.object({
        address: Joi.string().required(),
        city: Joi.string().required(),
        state: Joi.string().required()
    }).required(),
    modes: Joi.object({
        inPerson: Joi.boolean().required(),
        online: Joi.boolean().required()
    }).required(),
    imageUrl: Joi.string().uri().required()
});
```
```js
.post((req, res) => {
    const newWorkshop = req.body;

    // Check if body is sent and not empty
    if (!newWorkshop || Object.keys(newWorkshop).length === 0) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        status: 'error',
        message: 'The request body is empty. Workshop object expected.'
      });
    }

    // Validate using Joi
    const { error, value } = workshopSchema.validate(newWorkshop, {
      abortEarly: false,
      convert: false
    });

    if (error) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        status: 'error',
        message: 'Validation failed',
        details: error.details.map(err => err.message)
      });
    }

    newWorkshop.id = nextId++;
    workshops.push(newWorkshop);

    res.status(201).json({
      status: 'success',
      data: newWorkshop
    });
});
```

## Step 9: Understanding middleware, and defining and setting up custom middleware, global error-handling middleware
- Let us understand middleware better - we add a middleware to log the date and time of an incoming HTTP request, and the time taken to process the request (`time_of_sending_response` `-` `time_of_receiving_request`). This is set up as the first application-level middleware in the __middleware chain__ (series of middleware which are added using `app.use()`).
- The `next` method is called in order to pass control to the next middleware in the chain. A middleware either calls `next` to pass on control this way, or send out a response. Once a response is sent out, no middleware following it is invoked. Instead the code after the call to `next` in all preceding middleware in the chain are executed in reverse order now. This explains how the middleware below captures the time taken to process an incoming request.
- In `src/app.js`
```js
const app = express();

app.use(( req, res, next ) => {
    console.log( 'middleware 1 called' );
    const requestDate = new Date();
    
    next(); // now Express knows we are done processing the request
    
    console.log( 'middleware 1 after call to next' );
    const responseDate = new Date();

    console.log( 'Time for processing (in ms) = ', responseDate.getTime() - requestDate.getTime() );
});

// existing code...
app.use( express.json() );
```
- __EXERCISE__: Try setting up another middleware after the above one, and check the order of execution. See what happens if you do not call `next()`.
- Add the following middleware as the final ones in the middleware chain in `src/app.js`. They are invoked only if none of the routers handled the requests (i.e. for routes not serving any of the app's resources). They are thus used to handle errors (resource / page not found).
```js
// resource not found middleware
app.use(( req, res, next ) => {
    const err = new Error( 'Resource not found' );
    err.status = 404;
    next( err );
});

// global error handler middleware
app.use(( err, req, res, next ) => { // a middleware with 4 arguments is an "Error handler middleware"
    const status = err.status || 500;
    res.status( status ).json({
        status: 'error',
        message: err.message
    });
    // next(); // not a good idea to call next when a response is also sent
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen( PORT );
```
- __NOTE__: The last middleware is a special one referred to as the __global error handler middleware__ - note that it receives 4 arguments. It is invoked directly when any error is thrown in the router middleware - we see this next.
- We can now throw errors from `app/routes/workshops.route.js` which are caught by the global error handler. This was error responses are sent from the global error handler, ensuring uniform structure of response on errors.
```js
.post((req, res) => {
    const newWorkshop = req.body;

    // Check if body is sent and not empty
    if (!newWorkshop || Object.keys(newWorkshop).length === 0) {
      const err = new Error('The request body is empty. Workshop object expected.');
      err.status = 400;
      throw err;
    }

    // Validate using Joi
    const { error, value } = workshopSchema.validate(newWorkshop, {
      abortEarly: false,
      convert: false
    });

    if (error) {
      const err = new Error(error.details.map(d => d.message));
      err.status = 400;
      throw err;
    }

    // Add and return the new workshop
    newWorkshop.id = nextId++;
    workshops.push(newWorkshop);

    res.status(201).json({
      status: 'success',
      data: newWorkshop
    });
```
- __NOTE__: In early versions of Express, throwing errors from the router middleware was not the way to pass on control to the global error handler. Instead you needed to call `next( err );`
- Note that you can replace the call to next in the resource not found middleware as well. In `src/app.js`
```js
// resource not found middleware
app.use(( req, res ) => {
    const err = new Error( 'Resource not found' );
    err.status = 404;
    throw err;
});
```
- For structuring the application better, let us move the middleware to `src/middleware` folder.
- In `src/middleware/logger.js`
```js
const logger = ( req, res, next ) => {
    console.log( 'middleware 1 called' );
    const requestDate = new Date();
    
    next(); // now Express knows we are done processing the request
    
    console.log( 'middleware 1 after call to next' );
    const responseDate = new Date();

    console.log( 'Time for processing (in ms) = ', responseDate.getTime() - requestDate.getTime() );
};

module.exports = logger;
```
- In `src/middleware/errors.js`
```js
// resource not found middleware
const notFoundHandler = ( req, res ) => {
    const err = new Error( 'Resource not found' );
    err.status = 404;
    throw err;
};

// global error handler middleware
const errorHandler = ( err, req, res, next ) => { // a middleware with 4 arguments is an "Error handler middleware"
    const status = err.status || 500;
    res.status( status ).json({
        status: 'error',
        message: err.message
    });
    // next(); // not a good idea to call next when a response is also sent
};

module.exports = {
  notFoundHandler,
  errorHandler
};
```
- Import and set these up as middleware in `src/app.js`
```js
const express = require('express');

const logger = require( './middleware/logger' );
const { notFoundHandler, errorHandler } = require( './middleware/errors' );
```
```js
// change this...
app.use( logger );

// rest of code...
// ...

// change this...
app.use( notFoundHandler );
app.use( errorHandler );

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen( PORT );
```
- Finally we set up the popular HTTP request logging middleware - __Morgan__. Firstly, install morgan
```bash
npm i morgan
```
- Set it up as the first middleware - you may comment out our custom logger now. In `src/app.js`
```js
const morgan = require( 'morgan' );
```
```js
app.use( morgan( 'combined' ) ); // Passing 'combined' enables Apache HTTP server style request logs
// app.use( 'logger' );
```
- When requests are received, you will find logs in this format
```
::1 - - [13/Jul/2025:06:37:46 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 - "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/137.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
```

## Step 10: Refactoring to create controllers
- We refactor the app such that the route files set up the routing logic only. The actual request handling is done by controllers. Create `src/controllers/index.controller.js`
```js
const getIndex = ( req, res ) => {
    res.end( 'This is the workshops app. It serves details of workshops happening nearby.' );
};

const getHome = ( req, res ) => {
    res.redirect( '/' );
};

module.exports = {
    getIndex,
    getHome
};
```
- Now in `src/routes/index.route.js`
```js
const express = require( 'express' );
const controllers = require( '../controllers/index.controller' );

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', controllers.getIndex);
router.get('/home', controllers.getHome);

module.exports = router;
```
- Similarly create `src/controllers/workshops.controller.js`
```js
const Joi = require('joi');
const workshops = require( '../data/workshops.json' );

const timeSchema = Joi.object({
    hours: Joi.number().integer().min(0).max(23).required(),
    minutes: Joi.number().integer().min(0).max(59).required()
});

const workshopSchema = Joi.object({
    name: Joi.string().required(),
    category: Joi.string()
        .valid("frontend", "backend", "database", "devops", "language", "mobile")
        .required(),
    description: Joi.string().max(1024).required(),
    startDate: Joi.string().isoDate().required(),
    endDate: Joi.string().isoDate().required(),
    startTime: timeSchema.required(),
    endTime: timeSchema.required(),
    speakers: Joi.array().items(Joi.string()).min(1).required(),
    location: Joi.object({
        address: Joi.string().required(),
        city: Joi.string().required(),
        state: Joi.string().required()
    }).required(),
    modes: Joi.object({
        inPerson: Joi.boolean().required(),
        online: Joi.boolean().required()
    }).required(),
    imageUrl: Joi.string().uri().required()
});

let nextId = 13;

const getWorkshops = (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        status: 'success',
        data: workshops
    });
};

const postWorkshop = (req, res) => {
    const newWorkshop = req.body;

    // Check if body is sent and not empty
    if (!newWorkshop || Object.keys(newWorkshop).length === 0) {
        const err = new Error('The request body is empty. Workshop object expected.');
        err.status = 400;
        throw err;
    }

    // Validate using Joi
    const { error, value } = workshopSchema.validate(newWorkshop, {
        abortEarly: false,
        convert: false
    });

    if (error) {
        const err = new Error(error.details.map(d => d.message));
        err.status = 400;
        throw err;
    }

    // Add and return the new workshop
    newWorkshop.id = nextId++;
    workshops.push(newWorkshop);

    res.status(201).json({
        status: 'success',
        data: newWorkshop
    });
};

module.exports = {
    getWorkshops,
    postWorkshop
};
```
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`
```js
const express = require( 'express' );
const controllers = require( '../controllers/workshops.controller' );

const router = express.Router();

router.route('/')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshops )
    .post( controllers.postWorkshop );

module.exports = router;
```

## Step 11: Connecting to a MongoDB database
- We connect to a MongoDB database hosted on [MongoDB Atlas (official MongoDB cloud service)](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database). To do so, we can use the [official MongoDB driver for Node JS runtime](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/). But it is low-level - if we instead use something like [Mongoose JS](https://mongoosejs.com/), it can help us simplify queries, set up schema-based validation, provide hooks to tap into queries (running logic before and after certain queries) etc. We first install Mongoose.
```bash
npm i mongoose
```
- Update the `.env` file with `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`. Get the `<db_password>` from the instructor.
```
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://admin:<db_password>@cluster0.9d7mmqx.mongodb.net//workshopsDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```
- Create an `src/data/init.js` file. In it
```js
const mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

const connectionStr = process.env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING;

const connect = async () => {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect( connectionStr );
        console.log( 'connected to the db' );
    } catch( error ) {
        console.log( 'unable to connect to the db : ' + error.message );
        process.exit(1);
    }
};

connect();
```
- Set up the DB connection by invoking this file at startup in `src/app.js`
```js
require( 'dotenv' ).config();

// add this...
require( './data/init' );

const express = require( 'express' );
```
- You should get the _connected to the db_ message when you restart the app.

## Step 12: Define Workshops Model
- Mongoose let you define a __schema__ for a resource. When we try to add a new document to the MongoDB collection for example, the document is validated against the schema, and added only if it is valid. Once a schema is defined a __Model__ is created from it. The Model is a class for every resource that lets us make queries on the related collection.
- Define the Time schema in `src/data/models/Time.js` - we need to define the Model class only if a corresponding collection is needed. Time schema here is just part of the larger schema - Workshop (defined below). Hence a model is not to be created for it.
```js
/** No model is created from this schema (therefore no collection as well). This is intended to be used as part of other schemas */
const mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

const timeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    hours: {
        type: Number,
        required: true,
        min: 0,
        max: 23
    },
    minutes: {
        type: Number,
        default: 0,
        min: 0,
        max: 59
    },
    _id: false // a unique _id will be generated for every time part of every document. But we do not need it in this app.
});

module.exports = timeSchema;
```
- Define the Workshop resource schema and model in `src/data/models/Workshop.js`
```js
const mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );
const timeSchema = require( './Time' );

/**
 * In MongoDB, the documents can store related information together
 * For example, we can store the sessions (topics) for a particular workshop
 *      1. in the workshop document as an array, say "sessions" (preferred way)
 *      2. in a separate collection (say, Sessions), and store the array of related session ids
 */
const workshopsSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    // name: String, // if we do not want validation except type validation, we can do this

    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    category: {
        type: String,
        enum: [
            "frontend",
            "backend",
            "database",
            "devops",
            "language",
            "mobile"
        ]
    },
    // id: Number,
    description: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        maxLength: 1024
    },
    startDate: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now
    },
    endDate: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now
    },
    startTime: {
        type: timeSchema,
        required: true
    },
    endTime: {
        type: timeSchema,
        required: true
    },
    location: {
        address: String,
        city: String,
        state: String
    },
    modes: {
        inPerson: Boolean,
        online: Boolean
    },
    imageUrl: String,
    speakers: {
        type: [ String ],
        required: true
    },

    // 1. store sessions as an array - preferred way
    // sessions: {
    //     type: [
    //         sessionSchema
    //     ]
    // }

    // 2. store session ids
    // sessions: {
    //     type: [ mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId ]
    // },
  }
);

// The name of the collection is the plural form of the name of the Model
mongoose.model( 'Workshop', workshopsSchema );
```
- Import it in `src/data/init.js` in order to create the model at app startup.
```js
const mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

// create the collections (tables) if not present
require( './models/Workshop' );

// rest of code...
// ...
```

## Step 13: Define Workshop Service and use the MongoDB database
- We shall create methods to get workshops, create a new workshop etc. This logic may be used in various places repeatedly. Hence we define these in a separate _Services_ layer. Services in general refer to any logic shared across the application.
- In `src/services/workshops.service.js`, define the methods to get all workshops and create a new workshop
```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const Workshop = mongoose.model("Workshop");

const getAllWorkshops = async () => {
    const workshops = await Workshop.find();
    return workshops;
};

const addWorkshop = async (workshop) => {
    try {
        const insertedWorkshop = await Workshop.create(workshop);
        return insertedWorkshop;
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.name === "MongoServerError" && error.code === 11000 ) {
            const dbError = new Error(`Validation error : ${error.message}`);
            dbError.type = "ValidationError";
            throw dbError;
        }

        if (error.name === "ValidationError") {
            const dbError = new Error(`Validation error : ${error.message}`);
            dbError.type = "ValidationError";
            throw dbError;
        }

        if (error.name === "CastError") {
            const dbError = new Error(`Data type error : ${error.message}`);
            dbError.type = "CastError";
            throw dbError;
        }
    }
};

module.exports = {
    getAllWorkshops,
    addWorkshop,
};
```
- Modify the workshops controller to make use of the database. You don't need Joi for validation now as Mongoose does that for you. In `src/controllers/workshops.controller.js`
```js
const services = require( '../services/workshops.service' );

const getWorkshops = async (req, res) => {
    const workshops = await getAllWorkshops();

    res.json({
        status: 'success',
        data: workshops
    });
};

const postWorkshop = async (req, res) => {
    const newWorkshop = req.body;

    // Check if body is sent and not empty
    if (!newWorkshop || Object.keys(newWorkshop).length === 0) {
        const err = new Error('The request body is empty. Workshop object expected.');
        err.status = 400;
        throw err;
    }

    try {
        const updatedWorkshop = await addWorkshop( newWorkshop );
        res.status(201).json({
            status: 'success',
            data: updatedWorkshop
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        error.status = 400;
        throw error;
    }
};

module.exports = {
    getWorkshops,
    postWorkshop
};
```
- You should now be able to get all workshops in the database (initially empty), and add new workshops. Also check if field validations are working fine. You will see most are, but type-casting is allowed by default (eg. name is passed as a number and is accepted). We disable this behavior by setting this in `src/data/init.js`
```js
const mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

// disallows saving fields not in the schema
mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);
mongoose.set('strict', true);

// prevent casting - Be careful, this affects all String fields globally!
mongoose.Schema.Types.String.cast(v => {
  if (typeof v !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Value must be a string');
  }
  return v;
});

// create the collections (tables) if not present
require( './models/Workshop' );

// rest of code...
// ...
```
- Restart and check now - you should not be able to add name as a number (for example).

## Step 14: Adding sorting and pagination support
- We now support serving the list of workshop sorted by a user-supplied field, and also 10 records at a time. Additionally list API does not need to serve all fields to the client - hence we omit description, reducing the API response size. Both `find()` and `countDocuments()` take a filtering criteria as an argument. In the service `src/services/workshops.service.js`
```js
const getAllWorkshops = async (page, sortField, category = '') => {
    const filters = {};

    if (category) {
        filters.category = category;
    }

    // if we do not await, the query does not execute immediately (it will only execute when the function pauses/completes without pausing) - this allows us to customize the query (Add sorting, pagination etc.)
    const query = Workshop.find(filters);

    // We can either blacklist or whitelist fields. Here we blacklist (i.e. omit certain fields)
    query.select({
        description: false
    });

    if (sortField) {
        query.sort({
            [sortField]: 1,
        });
    }

    // pagination (assuming 10 per page)
    query.skip(10 * (page - 1)).limit(10);

    const [ workshops, count ] = await Promise.all(
        [
            query.exec(),
            Workshop.countDocuments(filters)
        ]
    );

    return {
        workshops,
        count
    };
};
```
- In the controller `src/controllers/workshops.controller.js` we add support for `page` and `sort` query string parameters.
```js
// http://localhost:3000/api/workshops
// http://localhost:3000/api/workshops?page=1&sort=name&category=frontend
const getWorkshops = async ( req, res ) => {
    let { page, sort : sortField, category } = req.query;

    if( page ) {
        page = +page;
    } else {
        page = 1;
    }

    const workshops = await services.getAllWorkshops( page, sortField, category );

    // send(), redirect(), json(), sendFile(), render() are other methods on response `res` object
    res.json({
        status: 'success',
        data: workshops
    });
};
```
- Some sample requests
```
http://localhost:3000/api/workshops
http://localhost:3000/api/workshops?page=1&sort=name&category=frontend
```

## Step 15: Support getting a single workshop by its id
- The Mongoose Model `findById()` let's us retrieve a document by its unique `_id`. We use it to set up a service method to get a workshop by its `_id` in `src/services/workshops.service.js`
```js
const getWorkshopById = async (id) => {
    try {
        const workshop = await Workshop.findById(id);

        if (workshop === null) {
            const error = new Error("No such workshop");
            error.type = "NotFound";
            throw error;
        }

        return workshop;
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.name === "CastError") {
            const dbError = new Error(`Data type error : ${error.message}`);
            dbError.type = "CastError";
            throw dbError;
        }

        if (error.type === "NotFound") {
            throw error;
        }
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    getAllWorkshops,
    getWorkshopById,
    addWorkshop,
};
```
- Now in `src/controllers/workshops.controller.js`, we support `GET /api/workshops/:id`. Note how a dynamic path parameter is configured in the Express router - the `:` indicates a dynamic path parameter, and `id` shall be the property within `req.params` which shall be set to the actual value.
```js
// http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/:id
const getWorkshopById = async ( req, res ) => {
    const id = req.params.id;

    try {
        const workshop = await services.getWorkshopById( id );

        res.json({
            status: 'success',
            data: workshop
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        error.status = 404;
        throw error;
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    getWorkshops,
    getWorkshopById,
    postWorkshop
};
```
- Add the route in `src/routes.workshops.route.js`. Note that since there is an extra dynamic path fragment, we need to configure the route separately.
```js
router
  .route('/')
  .get(controllers.getWorkshops)
  .post(controllers.postWorkshop);

router
  .route('/:id')
  .get(controllers.getWorkshopById);
```
- A sample request (surely, a workshop with the given `_id` shoudl exist in the database)
```
http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/6873679dac11710477aa5d60
```

## Step 16: Supporting update of workshop
- The Mongoose Model `findByIdAndUpdate()` let's us update a document having the unique `_id`. We use it to set up a service method to partially update a workshop matching the given `_id` in `src/services/workshops.service.js`
```js
const updateWorkshop = async (id, workshop) => {
    // NOTES
    // ---
    // 1. By default, MongoDB $set operator is applied to the fields. FOr an array field, we explicitly use an operator like $push to addd to an existing array (else it will be completely replaced).
    /**
     *  {
            $set: {
                "name": "Express JS v5",
                "category": "backend"
            }
        }
     */
    // 2. By default Mongoose will not perform schema validations on update. We need to explicitly configure Mongoose to do so.
    try {
        // we do not need to pass returnOriginal / new if it has been configured similalrly at a global level
        const updatedWorkshop = await Workshop.findByIdAndUpdate(
            id,
            workshop /*, {
            // returnOriginal: false
            new: true
        } */
        );
        return updatedWorkshop;
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.name === "CastError") {
            const dbError = new Error(`Data type error : ${error.message}`);
            dbError.type = "CastError";
            throw dbError;
        } else if (error.name === "ValidationError") {
            const dbError = new Error(`Validation error : ${error.message}`);
            dbError.type = "ValidationError";
            throw dbError;
        } else {
            throw error;
        }
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    getAllWorkshops,
    getWorkshopById,
    addWorkshop,
    updateWorkshop
};
```
- In the controller `app/src/controllers/workshops.controller.js`
```js
// @todo - Proper handling of error response status codes (400 vs 404)
const patchWorkshop = async ( req, res ) => {
    const id = req.params.id;

    const workshop = req.body;

    // if workshop = req.body -> {}
    if( Object.keys( workshop ).length === 0 ) {
        const err = new Error('The request body is empty. A partial Workshop object expected.');
        err.status = 400;
        throw err;
    }

    try {
        const updatedWorkshop = await services.updateWorkshop( id, workshop );
        res.json({
            status: 'success',
            data: updatedWorkshop
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        const err = new Error( error.message );
        err.status = 404;
        throw err;
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    getWorkshops,
    getWorkshopById,
    postWorkshop,
    patchWorkshop
};
```
- In the route file `app/src/routes/workshops.route.js`
```js
router.route('/')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshops )
    .post( controllers.postWorkshop );

router.route('/:id')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshopById )
    .patch( controllers.patchWorkshop );
``` 
- Make a request to update a workshop by its id. Sample request
```
localhost:3000/api/workshops/6873679dac11710477aa5d60

{
    "name": "Angular JS v1",
    "startTime": {
        "hours": 9,
        "minutes": 45
    },
    "endTime": {
        "hours": 13,
        "minutes": 45
    }
}
```
- You will see that validations do not run and the old details are returned. Now configure Mongoose to do validations on update, and return the updated document details by default. In `src/data/init.js`
```js
mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);
mongoose.set('strict', true);

// add these...
mongoose.set( 'returnOriginal', false );
mongoose.set( 'runValidators', true );

```
- Make an update request again. You will see the new details being returned.

## Step 17: Supporting deletion of workshop
- The Mongoose Model `findByIdAndDelete()` let's us update a document having the unique `_id`. We use it to set up a service method to partially update a workshop matching the given `_id` in `src/services/workshops.service.js`
```js
const deleteWorkshop = async (id) => {
    const deletedWorkshop = await Workshop.findByIdAndDelete(id);

    if (deletedWorkshop === null) {
        const error = new Error("No such workshop");
        error.type = "NotFound";
        throw error;
    }

    return deletedWorkshop;
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    getAllWorkshops,
    getWorkshopById,
    addWorkshop,
    updateWorkshop,
    deleteWorkshop
};
```
- In
```js
const deleteWorkshop = async ( req, res ) => {
    const id = req.params.id;

    try {
        await services.deleteWorkshop( id );
        // 204 -> use this status code for successful operation but you do not want to send any data in response (as in res.status(204).end())
        res.json({
            status: 'success'
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        error.status = 404;
        throw error;
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    getWorkshops,
    getWorkshopById,
    postWorkshop,
    patchWorkshop,
    deleteWorkshop
};
```
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`
```js
router.route('/')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshops )
    .post( controllers.postWorkshop );

router.route('/:id')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshopById )
    .patch( controllers.patchWorkshop )
    .delete( controllers.deleteWorkshop );
```
- Sample request
```
DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/6873679dac11710477aa5d60
```

## Step 18: Adding speakers
- If we do not want to replace and array field, and instead want to handle updates to it differently - for example by pushing new items to it, we need to do updates a bit differently (for example using the MongoDB `$addToSet` operator). We now support adding speakers for a workshop this way.
- In `src/services/workshops.service.js`
```js
const addSpeakers = async (id, speakers) => {
    // by default, $set is applied to the fields
    // Therefore we ned to construct the update clause ourselves
    const updateClause = {
        $addToSet: {
            speakers: {
                $each: speakers,
            },
        },
    };

    try {
        const updatedWorkshop = await Workshop.findByIdAndUpdate(
            id,
            updateClause
        );
        return updatedWorkshop;
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.name === "CastError") {
            const dbError = new Error(`Data type error : ${error.message}`);
            dbError.type = "CastError";
            throw dbError;
        } else if (error.name === "ValidationError") {
            const dbError = new Error(`Validation error : ${error.message}`);
            dbError.type = "ValidationError";
            throw dbError;
        } else {
            throw error;
        }
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    getAllWorkshops,
    getWorkshopById,
    addWorkshop,
    updateWorkshop,
    deleteWorkshop,
    addSpeakers
};
```
- In `src/controllers/workshops.controller.js`
```js
// http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/62ed07b0437f58e437c01f57/speakers
// body -> [
//     "john.doe@example.com",
//     "jane.doe@example.com"
// ]
const addSpeakers = async ( req, res ) => {
    const id = req.params.id;
    const speakers = req.body;

    if( !( speakers instanceof Array ) || speakers.length === 0 ) {
        const error = new Error( "Speakers must be a non-empty array. Data is missing or formed incorrectly" );
        error.status = 400;
        throw error;
    }

    try {
        const updatedWorkshop = await services.addSpeakers( id, speakers );
        res.json({
            status: 'success',
            data: updatedWorkshop
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        error.status = 404;
        throw error;
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    getWorkshops,
    getWorkshopById,
    postWorkshop,
    patchWorkshop,
    deleteWorkshop,
    addSpeakers
};
```
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`
```js
router.route('/')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshops )
    .post( controllers.postWorkshop );

router.route('/:id')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshopById )
    .patch( controllers.patchWorkshop )
    .delete( controllers.deleteWorkshop );

router.route('/:id/speakers' )
    .patch( controllers.addSpeakers );
```
- Sample request
```
PATCH localhost:3000/api/workshops/6873676dc9f4ad0bf84713f0/speakers

[
    "Diana Taylor",
    "David Taylor"
]
```

## Step 19: Adding topics for workshops - The Session Model
- We shall add topics (called sessions in the application) for a workshop. Begin by defining a `Session` model in `src/data/models/Session.js`
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const sessionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  workshopId: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  sequenceId: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  speaker: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  duration: {
    type: Number,
    required: true, // assuming duration is in hours
    min: 0.25        // optional: 15 minutes as minimum
  },
  level: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['Basic', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced'],
    required: true
  },
  abstract: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    maxlength: 1024
  },
  upvoteCount: {
    type: Number,
    default: 0
  }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Session', sessionSchema);
```
- Import the new model file in `src/data/init.js` so the `Session` model is defined at app startup.
```js
require( './models/Workshop' );
require( './models/Session' );
```

## Step 20: API to add a topics (sessions)
- In `src/services/sessions.service.js`
```js
const mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );
const Session = mongoose.model( 'Session' );
const Workshop = mongoose.model( 'Workshop' );

const addSession = async ( session ) => {
    let workshop;

    try {
        workshop = await Workshop.findById( session.workshopId );

        if ( workshop ) {
            const insertedSession = await Session.create( session );
            return insertedSession;
        }
    } catch( error ) {
        if( error.name === 'ValidationError' ) {
            const dbError = new Error( `Validation error : ${error.message}` );
            dbError.type = 'ValidationError';
            throw dbError;
        }

        if( error.name === 'CastError' ) {
            const dbError = new Error( `Data type error : ${error.message}` );
            dbError.type = 'CastError';
            throw dbError;
        }
    }

    if( !workshop ) {
        const error = new Error( `Workshop not found` );
        error.type = 'ValidationError';
        throw error;
    }
};

module.exports = {
    addSession
};
```
- In `src/controllers/sessions.controller.js`
```js
const services = require( '../services/sessions.service' );

const postSession = async ( req, res ) => {
    const session = req.body;
    
    try {
        let newSession = await services.addSession( session );
        
        res.status( 201 ).json({
            status: 'success',
            data: newSession
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        error.status = 400;
        throw error;
    }
};

module.exports = {
    postSession
}
```
- In `src/routes/sessions.route.js`
```js
const express = require( 'express' );
const controllers = require( '../controllers/sessions.controller' );

const router = express.Router();

router.route('/')
    .post( controllers.postSession );

module.exports = router;
```
- Add the new router as a middleware in `src/app.js`
```js
const sessionsRouter = require( './routes/sessions.route' );
```
```js
app.use( '/api/sessions', sessionsRouter );
```
- Sample request
```
POST /api/sessions

{
    "workshopId": "68736598bcd41b2ebd0233e1",
    "sequenceId": 1,
    "name": "Introduction to Express JS",
    "speaker": "John Doe",
    "duration": 1,
    "level": "Basic",
    "abstract": "In this session you will learn about the basics of Express JS"
}
```

## Step 21: Add a topic through workshops route
- With REST APIs, related resources can often be accesed in multiple ways. For example, we shall support accessing sessions both standalone (`/api/sessions`), and through the resource workshop resource (`/api/workshops/:id/sessions`). We now make changes to support access via the second route.
- In `src/controllers/workshops.controller.js`
```js
const sessionServices = require( '../services/sessions.service' );
```
```js
const postSession = async ( req, res ) => {
    const workshopId = req.params.id;

    const session = {
        // workshopId: workshopId,
        workshopId,
        ...req.body
    };
    
    try {
        let newSession = await sessionServices.addSession( session );
        
        res.status( 201 ).json({
            status: 'success',
            data: newSession
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        error.status = 400;
        throw error;
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    // existing exports...
    // ...,

    postSession
};
```
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js` add this
```js
router.route( '/:id/sessions' )
    .post( controllers.postSession );
```
- Sample request
```
POST /api/workshops/68736598bcd41b2ebd0233e1/sessions

{
    "sequenceId": 1,
    "name": "Introduction to Express JS",
    "speaker": "John Doe",
    "duration": 1,
    "level": "Basic",
    "abstract": "In this session you will learn about the basics of Express JS"
}
```

## Step 22: Fetching all sessions of a workshop
- In `src/services/sessions.service.js`
```js
const getSessions = async ( workshopId ) => {
    let workshop;

    try {
        workshop = await Workshop.findById( workshopId );

        if( workshop ) {
            const sessions = await Session.find({
                workshopId: workshopId
            });
            return sessions;
        }
    } catch( error ) {
        if( error.name === 'CastError' ) {
            const dbError = new Error( `Data type error : ${error.message}` );
            dbError.type = 'CastError';
            throw dbError;
        }
    }

    if( !workshop ) {
        const error = new Error( `Workshop not found` );
        error.type = 'NotFound';
        throw error;
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    addSession,
    getSessions
};
```
- In `src/controllers/workshops.controller.js`
```js
// Sample: http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/62ed150ad0d302eca77f0f38/sessions
const getSessions = async ( req, res ) => {
    const workshopId = req.params.id;

    try {
        const sessions = await sessionServices.getSessions( workshopId );
        res.json({
            status: 'success',
            data: sessions
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        if( error.type === 'CastError' ) {
            error.status = 400;
            throw error;
        } else if( error.type === 'NotFound' ) {
            error.status = 404;
            throw error;
        }
    }
};
```
```js
module.exports = {
    // existing exports...
    // ...,

    getSessions
};
```
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`
```js
router.route( '/:id/sessions' )
    .get( controllers.getSessions )
    .post( controllers.postSession );
```
- Sample request
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/62ed150ad0d302eca77f0f38/sessions
```
- __EXERCISE__: Modify the service, controller and add count of documents to the response.

## Step 23: Embed sessions when fetching details of a workshop
- We enable serving the list of sessions along with the workshop details. Make changes in `src/data/models/Workshop.js` so it gets a __virtual field__ which shall hold the array of sessions for the workshop. When sending out workshop(s) in the response we generally would like the virtual fields to be serialized to JSON as well. For this reason we add appropriate options when setting up the `Workshop` model.
```js
const workshopsSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        // the field defintions
        // existing code...
    },
    {
        toObject: { virtuals: true },
        toJSON: { virtuals: true }
    }
);

workshopsSchema.virtual( 'sessions', {
    ref: 'Session',
    localField: '_id',
    foreignField: 'workshopId' // the field in the other collection (Session) that references a document in this collection (Workshop)
});
```
- In `src/services/workshops.service.js` makes changes to populate the virtual `sessions` property with the list of sessions for the workshop, if `embedSessions` is set to `true`. For this we use the Mongoose model method - `populate()`
```js
const getWorkshopById = async (id, embedSessions = false) => {
    try {
        const query = Workshop.findById( id );
        
        if ( embedSessions ) {
            query.populate( 'sessions' );
        }

        const workshop = await query.exec();
        
        // rest of code...
        // ...
    } catch ( error ) {
        // rest of code...
        // ...
    }
}
```
- In `src/controllers/workshops.controller.js` pass on `embedSessions` based on the `embed` query string parameter value.
```js
// http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/:id
// http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/:id?embed=sessions
const getWorkshopById = async ( req, res ) => {
    const id = req.params.id;
    const embedSessions = req.query.embed === 'sessions';

    try {
        const workshop = await services.getWorkshopById( id, embedSessions );

        res.json({
            status: 'success',
            data: workshop
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        error.status = 404;
        throw error;
    }
};
```
- Sample requests
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/62ed150ad0d302eca77f0f38
GET http://localhost:3000/api/workshops/62ed150ad0d302eca77f0f38?embed=sessions
```

## Step 24: Enable voting on sessions
- We enable user to upvote / downvote on sessions. The session `upvoteCount` property is incremented / decremented in such case using the `$inc` operator of MongoDB.
- In `src/services/sessions.service.js`
```js
const upvoteSession = async (sessionId) => {
  try {
    const session = await Session.findByIdAndUpdate(
      sessionId,
      { $inc: { upvoteCount: 1 } }
    );

    if (!session) {
      const error = new Error('Session not found');
      error.type = 'ValidationError';
      throw error;
    }

    return session;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'CastError') {
      const dbError = new Error(`Invalid session ID: ${error.message}`);
      dbError.type = 'CastError';
      throw dbError;
    }

    throw error;
  }
};

const downvoteSession = async (sessionId) => {
  try {
    const session = await Session.findByIdAndUpdate(
      sessionId,
      { $inc: { upvoteCount: -1 } }
    );

    if (!session) {
      const error = new Error('Session not found');
      error.type = 'ValidationError';
      throw error;
    }

    return session;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'CastError') {
      const dbError = new Error(`Invalid session ID: ${error.message}`);
      dbError.type = 'CastError';
      throw dbError;
    }

    throw error;
  }
};

module.exports = {
    addSession,
    getSessions,
    upvoteSession,
    downvoteSession
};
```
- In `src/controllers/sessions.controller.js`
```js
const patchUpvote = async (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;

  try {
    const updatedSession = await services.upvoteSession(id);
    res.json({
      status: 'success',
      data: updatedSession
    });
  } catch (error) {
    error.status = 400;
    throw error;
  }
};

const patchDownvote = async (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;

  try {
    const updatedSession = await services.downvoteSession(id);
    res.json({
      status: 'success',
      data: updatedSession
    });
  } catch (error) {
    error.status = 400;
    throw error;
  }
};

module.exports = {
    postSession,
    patchUpvote,
    patchDownvote
}
```
- In `src/routes/sessions.route.js`
```js
router.patch( '/:id/upvote', controllers.patchUpvote );
router.patch( '/:id/downvote', controllers.patchDownvote );
```
- Sample request
```
PATCH localhost:3000/api/sessions/6873b8b9f5aef68c5fcccad0/upvote
PATCH localhost:3000/api/sessions/6873b8b9f5aef68c5fcccad0/downvote
```

## Step 25: Enable authentication and authorization - Add user model
- We now enable authentication and authorization. First add the `User` model in `src/data/models/User.js`. Note how we set up custom validators on certain paths (fields). Note that these have to be added to the schema before the model is created from it.
```js
const mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    role: {
        type: String,
        default: 'general',
        enum: [ 'admin', 'general' ]
    }
});

const emailPat = /^[A-Za-z0-9_\.]+@example\.com$/;
const passwordPat = /^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])[a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^&*]{8,16}$/;

// we can customize the schema further before model is created
userSchema.path( 'email' ).validate(
    email => emailPat.test( email ),
    "Invalid email. Please make sure the email is an example.com email."
);

userSchema.path( 'password' ).validate(
    password => passwordPat.test( password ),
    "Password must have at least 1 upper case, 1 lower case, 1 digit, 1 special characters, and should be 8 characters in length."
);

mongoose.model( 'User', userSchema );
```
- Import the new model file in `src/data/init.js` so the `User` model is defined at app startup.
```js
require( './models/User' );
require( './models/Workshop' );
require( './models/Session' );
```

## Step 26: Add user registration support
- In `src/services/users.service.js`
```js
const mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );
const User = mongoose.model( 'User' );

const addUser = async ( user ) => {
    try {
        const insertedUser = await User.create( user );
        return insertedUser;
    } catch( error ) {
        if( error.name === 'ValidationError' ) {
            const dbError = new Error( `Validation error : ${error.message}` );
            dbError.type = 'ValidationError';
            throw dbError;
        }
        
        if( error.name === 'CastError' ) {
            const dbError = new Error( `Data type error : ${error.message}` );
            dbError.type = 'CastError';
            throw dbError;
        }

        throw error;
    }
};

module.exports = {
    addUser
};
```
- In `src/controllers/users.controller.js`
```js
const services = require( '../services/users.service' );

const register = async ( req, res ) => {
    const user = req.body;

    // if user = req.body -> {}
    if( Object.keys( user ).length === 0 ) {
        const error = new Error( "Body is missing" );
        error.status = 400;
        throw error;
    }

    try {
        const updatedUser = await services.addUser( user );
        const userToSend = {
            ...updatedUser.toObject()
        };
        delete userToSend.password;

        res.status( 201 ).json({
            status: 'success',
            data: userToSend // internally userToSend.toJSON() runs which returns details about the user that are part of the user document
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        error.status = 400;
        throw error;
    }
};

module.exports = {
    register
};
```
- In `src/routes/users.route.js`
```js
const express = require( 'express' );
const services = require( '../controllers/users.controller' );

const router = express.Router();

router.post( '/register', services.register );

module.exports = router;
```
- Set the router as an application middleware in `src/app.js`
```js
const usersRouter = require( './routes/users.route' );
```
```js
app.use( indexRouter );
app.use( '/api/auth', usersRouter );
app.use( '/api/workshops', workshopsRouter );
app.use( '/api/sessions', sessionsRouter );
```
- You should now be able to register a user. Sample request
```
POST /api/auth/register

{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "password": "Password123#",
    "role": "admin"
}
```
- __NOTE__: A public registration API like this would not support adding users with _admin_ role. Here it is enabled just for convenience.

## Step 27: Hashing passwords using bcrypt
- Passwords need to be hashed and store in databases so they are not available to anyone, including those with access to the database. The password needs to be __salted__ for additional security (even if 2 users have the same password, the hashed values are different - so a compromised password for one user, cannot be used to break into another user's account with the same password).
- The `bcrypt` package that uses C++ modules under-the-hood (or `bcryptjs` for a pure JS implementation that is not as performant) is popularly used for this purpose (what we need can be implemented using the built-in crypto module, but the API is not as friendly). Install it
```bash
npm i bcrypt
```
- In `src/data/models/User.js` we set up a pre-save hook that hashes the password when a user is added (user registration). A convenience method is also added to the model methods, that will help verify the plain text password against the hashed password at the time of user login. Note that these have to be added to the schema before the model is created from it.
```js
const bcrypt = require( 'bcrypt' );
```
```js
// IMPORTANT: Decides the "strength" of the salt (should not be too high as salting will take long time and occupy CPU time (blocking) - nothing else will execute in the app in that time. should not be too low, else the password is not securely hashed)
const SALT_ROUNDS = 10;

// IMPORTANT: DO NOT use arrow function here (the "this" binding will not be set correctly for an arrow function)
userSchema.pre( 'save', function( done ) {
    const user = this; // const user -> new User()

    if( !user.isModified( 'password' ) ) {
        return done();
    }

    bcrypt.genSalt( SALT_ROUNDS, function( err, salt ) {
        if( err ) {
            return done( err ); // Mongoose will not insert the user document 
        }

        bcrypt.hash( user.password, salt, function( err, hashedPassword ) {
            if( err ) {
                return done( err );
            }

            user.password = hashedPassword;
            done(); // pass no arguments to done() to signify success
        });
    })
});

// will be used to compare plain text password with the hashed password at the time of login
userSchema.methods.checkPassword = async function( plainTextPassword ) {
    const hashedPassword = this.password;
    
    // this line will throw an error sometimes
    // if on the other hand bcrypt is able to compare it will return true / false
    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare( plainTextPassword, hashedPassword );
    return isMatch;
}

mongoose.model( 'User', userSchema );
```

## Step 28: Add login support
- In `src/services/users.service.js`
```js
const getUserByEmail = async ( email ) => {
    const user = await User.findOne({
        // email: email
        email
    });

    if( user === null ) {
        const error = new Error( 'Bad Credentials' );
        error.type = 'BadCredentials';
        throw error;
    }

    return user;
};

const checkPassword = async ( user, plainTextPassword ) => {
    let  isMatch;

    try {
        isMatch = await user.checkPassword( plainTextPassword );
    } catch( err ) {
        const error = new Error( 'Something went wrong checking credentials' );
        error.type = 'DBError';
        throw error;
    }

    if( !isMatch ) {
        const error = new Error( 'Bad Credentials' );
        error.type = 'BadCredentials';
        throw error;
    }

    return isMatch;
};

module.exports = {
    addUser,
    getUserByEmail,
    checkPassword
};
```
- In `src/controllers/users.controller.js`
```js
const login = async ( req, res ) => {
    const credentials = req.body;

    if( !( credentials?.email && credentials?.password ) ) {
        const error = new Error( "Bad request" );
        error.status = 400;
        throw error;
    }

    const { email, password } = credentials;

    try {
        const user = await services.getUserByEmail( email );

        await services.checkPassword( user, password );

        res.json({
            status: 'success',
            data: "Token to be generated"
        });
    } catch( error ) {
        if( error.type === 'BadCredentials' ) {
            // It is a good practice not to expose to the client what exactly went wrong - such information could aid hackers
            const err = new Error( "Bad credentials" );
            err.status = 403; // Email, password is provided but is incorrect -> 403
            throw err;
        } else {
            error.status = 500;
            throw error;
        }
    }
};

module.exports = {
    register,
    login
};
```
- In `src/routes/users.route.js`, add the login route
```js
router.post( '/register', services.register );
router.post( '/login', services.login );
```
- __IMPORTANT__: You will need to create a fresh user account, as the one you may have created at the end of the earlier registration step would have the password stored as plain text.
- Sample request
```
POST /api/auth/login

{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "password": "Password123#"
}
```

## Step 29: Generate and send a JWT on successful login
- We shall generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) using the `jsonwebtoken` package. JWT hold user claims (privileges) along with other user information. The claims are digitally signed using a secret key on the server, and hence can be verified when access to secured API endpoints is needed. Install the package
```bash
npm i jsonwebtoken
```
- Add the secret key to `.env` - it will be used to sign the JWT (any key that is "secret enough" will do - like a password)
```
JWT_SECRET=xyz123abc%^&#
```
- In `src/controllers/users.controller.js` make the following change in the `login` method
```js
const jwt = require( 'jsonwebtoken' );
```
```js
await services.checkPassword( user, password );

// replace the code sending response currently with this...
const claims = {
    role: user.role,
    email: user.email, // info useful for the backend in future requests
};

// The secret key which is used to generate the digital signature must be stored in environment variable and NEVER in code
jwt.sign( claims, process.env.JWT_SECRET, function( error, token ) {
    // some problem in generating JWT
    if( error ) {
        const err = new Error( "Internal Server Error" );
        err.status = 500;
        throw err;
    }

    res.json({
        status: 'success',
        data: {
            name: user.name,
            email: user.email, // useful for frontend app
            // token: token
            token
        }
    });
});
```

## Step 30: Set up an authentication middleware
- In `src/middleware/auth.js` add and export an `authenticate` middleware
```js
const jwt = require( 'jsonwebtoken' );

const authenticate = ( req, res, next ) => {
    const authHeader = req.header('Authorization');

    if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
        const err = new Error( 'Missing or invalid Authorization header' );
        err.status = 401;
        throw err;
    }

    const token = authHeader.replace('Bearer ', '');
    
    jwt.verify( token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, function( error, claims ) {
        if( error ) {
            const err = new Error( 'Bad credentials' );
            err.status = 401;
            throw err;
        }

        res.locals.claims = claims;
        
        next();
    });

};

module.exports = {
    authenticate
};
```
- Apply the above as a route-level middleware in `src/routes/workshops.route.js`. The order is important - it must be applied before the controller for the route, so that user is authenticated before the request reaches the controller.
```js
const { authenticate } = require( '../middleware/auth' );
```
```js
router.route('/')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshops )
    .post( authenticate, controllers.postWorkshop );
```
- You should now, not be able to add a workshop unless you send the token correctly. Sample request
```
POST /api/workshops

Header
---
Authorization: Bearer <token_obtained_on_login>

Body
---
{
    "name": "jQuery",
    "category": "frontend",
    "description": "jQuery is a JavaScript library",
    "startDate": "2020-03-01T04:00:00.000Z",
    "endDate": "2020-03-03T08:00:00.000Z",
    "startTime": {
        "hours": 9,
        "minutes": 30
    },
    "endTime": {
        "hours": 13,
        "minutes": 30
    },
    "speakers": [
        "John Doe",
        "Jane Doe"
    ],
    "location": {
        "address": "Tata Elxsi, Prestige Shantiniketan",
        "city": "Bangalore",
        "state": "Karnataka"
    },
    "modes": {
        "inPerson": true,
        "online": false
    },
    "imageUrl": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/JQuery_logo.svg/524px-JQuery_logo.svg.png"
}
```

## Step 31: Set up an authorization middleware
- In `src/middleware/auth.js` add and export an `authorize` middleware - it is created as a higher-order function (it is a function that exports a function) in order to support configuring roles that the returned middleware needs to allow.
```js
const authorize = ( allowedRoles ) => { // when called, this returns the middleware
    return ( req, res, next ) => { // this is the actual middleware
        const { claims } = res.locals;

        if( !allowedRoles.includes( claims.role ) ) {
            const error = new Error( 'Unauthorized' );
            // for a valid user, but one who has insufficient privileges (send 403)
            error.status = 403;
            throw error;
        }

        next();
    };
};

module.exports = {
    authenticate,
    authorize
};
```
- Apply the above as a route-level middleware in `src/routes/workshops.route.js`. The order is important - it must be applied after the `authenticate` middleware for the route (but before the controller), so that user is authenticated and user details, specifically the _role_, is available on `res.locals` when authorization check is done.
```js
const { authenticate, authorize } = require( '../middleware/auth' );
```
```js
router.route('/')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshops )
    .post( authenticate, authorize( [ 'admin' ] ), controllers.postWorkshop );
```
- You should now, not be able to add a workshop unless you send the token of an _admin_ user. Try with the token of an _admin_ and a _general_ user. Sample request
```
POST /api/workshops

Header
---
Authorization: Bearer <token_obtained_on_login_of_an_admin_user>

Body
---
{
    "name": "jQuery",
    "category": "frontend",
    "description": "jQuery is a JavaScript library",
    "startDate": "2020-03-01T04:00:00.000Z",
    "endDate": "2020-03-03T08:00:00.000Z",
    "startTime": {
        "hours": 9,
        "minutes": 30
    },
    "endTime": {
        "hours": 13,
        "minutes": 30
    },
    "speakers": [
        "John Doe",
        "Jane Doe"
    ],
    "location": {
        "address": "Tata Elxsi, Prestige Shantiniketan",
        "city": "Bangalore",
        "state": "Karnataka"
    },
    "modes": {
        "inPerson": true,
        "online": false
    },
    "imageUrl": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/JQuery_logo.svg/524px-JQuery_logo.svg.png"
}
```

## Step 32: Set up authentication/authorization for relevant API endpoints
- All endpoints that mutate __workshops__ resource are allowed for _admin_ role, and all endpoints that mutate __sessions__ resource are allowed for authenticated users (no role-specific authorization).
- In `src/routes/workshops.route.js`
```js
router.route('/')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshops )
    .post( authenticate, authorize( [ 'admin' ] ), controllers.postWorkshop );

router.route('/:id')
    .get( controllers.getWorkshopById )
    .patch( authenticate, authorize( [ 'admin' ] ), controllers.patchWorkshop )
    .delete( authenticate, authorize( [ 'admin' ] ), controllers.deleteWorkshop );

router.route('/:id/speakers' )
    .patch( authenticate, authorize( [ 'admin' ] ), controllers.addSpeakers );

router.route( '/:id/sessions' )
    .get( controllers.getSessions )
    .post( authenticate, controllers.postSession );
```
- In `src/routes/sessions.route.js`
```js
const express = require( 'express' );
const services = require( '../controllers/sessions.controller' );
const { authenticate, authorize } = require( '../middleware/auth' );

const router = express.Router();

router.route('/')
    // .get( services.getSessions )
    .post( authenticate, services.postSession );

router.patch( '/:id/upvote', authenticate, services.patchUpvote );
router.patch( '/:id/downvote', authenticate, services.patchDownvote );

module.exports = router;
```

## Step 34: Setup CORS middleware
```bash
npm i cors
```
- In `src/app.js`
```js
const cors = require(cors);
```
```js
app.use(cors()); // @todo improve this to restrict based on domain, and allow domain based on environment (development/production)
```

## Step 35: Implement session voting feature using web sockets
- Web sockets enable real-time 2-way data communication between client and server in web applications. The Web Socket protocol is built on top of HTTP in the sense the `ws` connection is established over `http` / `https`. We enable web socket support using `socket.io`. Install it.
```bash
npm i socket.io
```
- In `src/middleware/socket-auth.js`
```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const socketAuthMiddleware = (socket, next) => {
  console.log( 'socket middleware' );
  const token = socket.handshake.auth?.token || socket.handshake.headers['authorization'];

  if (!token || !token.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return next(new Error('Authentication token missing or invalid'));
  }

  const actualToken = token.replace('Bearer ', '');

  try {
    const payload = jwt.verify(actualToken, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    socket.user = payload; // attach decoded user info to the socket
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    next(new Error('Invalid or expired token'));
  }
};

module.exports = socketAuthMiddleware;
```
- In `src/sockets/voting.socket.js`
```js
const sessionService = require('../services/sessions.service');
const socketAuth = require('../middleware/socket-auth');

module.exports = (io) => {
  // Attach middleware to every connection
  io.use(socketAuth);

  io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log(`User ${socket.user?.email || socket.user?.id} connected via socket`, socket.id);

    socket.on('upvote', async (sessionId) => {
      try {
        const updated = await sessionService.upvoteSession(sessionId);
        io.emit('sessionUpdated', updated);
      } catch (err) {
        socket.emit('error', { message: err.message });
      }
    });

    socket.on('downvote', async (sessionId) => {
      try {
        const updated = await sessionService.downvoteSession(sessionId);
        io.emit('sessionUpdated', updated);
      } catch (err) {
        socket.emit('error', { message: err.message });
      }
    });

    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
      console.log('User disconnected:', socket.id);
    });
  });
};
```
- In `src/app.js`
```js
const http = require( 'http' );
const { Server } = require('socket.io');
```
```js
// app.listen( PORT );

// Replaced app.listen( PORT ) with the following for setting up web socket support
const server = http.createServer(app);

// Attach Socket.IO
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: '*', // ⚠️ set this appropriately for production
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PATCH']
  }
});

require('./sockets/voting.socket')(io); // socket logic in separate module

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Step 36: Enable file upload
- We use `multer` package to upload files. Install `multer`
```bash
npm i multer
```
